# The Daily Weather App

If You want to know the forecast information for up to 16 days to make a plane for your vacation or you want to know what clothes you need to wear each day during the week then the Daily Weather app
would help you the best.

## Project Description

My Weather app provides real-time weather information for cities worldwide. All you need to do is just enter the name of any city, then the app will give you accurate weather data, including precipitation, wind speed, and much more info for the next 3 days (you can also choose upfront the number of days up to 16 days). In addition, if you forget to input a city and clicked the submit button or pressed Enter key, an error message will prompt you.

Stay informed and ready for all kinds of weather with the Daily Weather App.
