### Should have

- The app will have a search bar with submit button
- the required information will be displayed on cards for 3 days regarding the city that has been chosen
- In case the user hasn't chosen any number of days or city the app will display an ERROR message.

#### Nice to have

Select element, to select the number of days If the user likes to see more days
